Analyse the TailwindCSS classes used in your application

![TailwindCSS Analysis](./app/src/assets/analysis-300px.png)

Here's why:

- Get overall view of the styles used in your project. Helps to monitor if any styles are prohibited in your organization. (One might not prefer CSS grid if the application needs to support IE browser)
- View the overview of colors and fonts used in the application. Useful for verification by the design team

## Usage

Navigate to the project that uses the TailwindCSS and run the command to generate the analysis report.

```
npx tailwindcss-analysis
```
